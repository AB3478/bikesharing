# bikesharing

### Overview 

#### An angel investor has expressed interested in providing the seed funding to explore a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. The mechanics of making the business work will likely be quite different than Citibike in New York City, New York. This analysis explores how the bike sharing business works in New York City and creates a proposal on how it might work in Des Moines.

#### 1) Analysis of checkout times for users revealed that the majority of bike-share riders will use a bike for an hour or less. This information is helpful in determining the number of initial bikes necessary to purchase to start the bike-sharing program in Des Moines. We would also need to know the expected daily number of customers throughout the year.

#### 2) Checkout times by gender is helpful to gain a better understanding of who is most likely to use the bike-sharing program. The company may be interested in future marketing campaigns to increase the number of female customers.

#### 3) Trips by weekday per hour highlight when the majority of bike-sharing trips occur. From this information we can anticipate that many customers will be interested in using the bike-sharing program for their daily commute.

#### 4) Trip by gender further affirms two of the earlier results:  1) that the majority of riders are male and 2) several customers rely on bike-sharing during typical commuting hours.

#### 5) Trips by gender by weekday helps highlight which days of the week or busiest. This information is helpful for identifying peak times when the majority of bikes should be available and slower days that may be better suited for taking bikes out of service for maintenance.

#### 6) The “August Peak Hours” table helps confirm when customers are most likely to use the bike-sharing the program. The table illustrates two key peak times, first in the morning between 8am and 9am and then in the evening between 5pm and 6pm.

#### 7) The total customer count is likely to be significantly lower in Des Moines. However, information on the customer type—and whether they’re a Citibike subscriber—could be helpful in estimating the proportion of subscribers vs. customers in Iowa.

### Summary
#### Information on the population of Des Moines and city-wide interest in a bike-sharing program would help scale start up needs for a new bike-sharing program in Iowa. The overall program size, including the number of bikes, required maintenance, as well as customer service needs, will likely be significantly greater in New York City. Despite these differences, there are similarities we can draw on from our analysis of New York City. The information on peak days and times will likely remain consistent, as well as the proportion of subscribers.
